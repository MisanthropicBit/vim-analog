How to contribute
-----------------

Contributing is pretty straightforward, but **please** ensure the following:

* [Your commit messages do not suck](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
* All commits have been squashed into a single commit
* You report which version of `vim` you are using as well as what kind (`mvim`, `nvim` etc.)
* You stick to the existing style
* You have tested with no or a minimal `vimrc` to ensure that the issue is caused by `vim-analog`
  and not by your own configuration

Otherwise:

1. Fork this project and make modifications
2. Submit a pull request
